<p>Dear Mama</p>
    <p> I love you</p>
    <p>I love you</p>
    <p>You are appreciated</p>
    <p>When I was young me and my mama had beef</p>
    <p>Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets</p>
    <p>Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face</p>
    <p>Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place</p>
    <p>uspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool</p>
    <p>With the big boys, breaking all the rules</p>
    <p>I shed tears with my baby sister</p>
    <p> Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids</p>
    <p>And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama</p>
    <p>When things went wrong we'd blame mama</p>
    <p> I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell</p>
    <p>Hugging on my mama from a jail cell</p>
    <p>And who'd think in elementary?</p>
    <p>Hey! I see the penitentiary, one day</p>
    <p>And running from the police, that's right</p>
    <p>Mama catch me, put a whooping to my backside</p>
    <p>Andâ€¦</p>
